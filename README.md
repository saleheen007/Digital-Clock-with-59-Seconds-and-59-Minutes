# Digital-Clock-with-59-seconds-and-59-minutes

This particular project was given as a team to build a digital clock using logic gates and flipflops in logisim software.
My first task was to build a counter that counts from 0 to 9 but skips number 4, which I made using T flip-flops. I also helped to build the other counters as well.
Though my main task was to build the logic that would help us skipping 44th second/minute in the clock. The process is given in the project report.

# NOTE: To make sure the clock circuit works please place all the files in one separate folder. It is necessary as the clock final circuit imports other circuits given here.
